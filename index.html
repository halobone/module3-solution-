		<section id="chicken-description"> <h2 id="chicken" class="text-center">  Chicken </h2> <p> Enjoy traditional British dining with a modern twist at Audleys Wood in Hampshire.  Our Conservatory restaurant sits at the very heart of the hotel and offers a light, bright and elegant space in which to enjoy dinner and afternoon tea overlooking the grounds. Our dinner menu features classic and contemporary dishes in addition to Hand Picked favourites and signature plates inspired by the seasons and injected with plenty of local influences. Afternoon Tea has also been given a modern twist here with sweet and savoury afternoon teas and gluten or dairy free alternatives with identical theatre! In addition to the main restaurant, there is a mix characterful and modern private dining rooms for small or larger groups looking to celebrate in style, be it an anniversary, birthday, baby shower or corporate event. Adam’s was opened in 2013 by husband and wife team Adam and Natasha in a former sandwich shop. Intended as a two year ‘pop-up’ the couple continued to look for a location for the restaurant’s permanent home, keeping their search local after falling for the charms of the city centre. Patience paid off when in Summer 2015 they took on three floors of New Oxford House located just around the corner on Waterloo Street. After a complete renovation the restaurant was able to move into its new location in January 2016. The 36 cover dining room located on the ground floor serves a 3 Course Menu alongside the signature Tasting Menu and a weekday Lunch Menu. A private dining room adjacent to the main dining room is available for that exclusive feel and is perfect for speeches or presentations for up to 17 guests. The larger premises has also seen the creation of a Chef’s Table located within the kitchen environment which is available to hire exclusively for up to 12 guests. This unique experience is also open to smaller groups of diners where individuals will be sat together at the marble table sampling Adam’s bespoke Chef’s Table Tasting Menu. My aim is not to baffle, but to excite and enthuse guests with the accurate cooking of quality ingredients served in an approachable environment.  We hope to create a unique experience for each diner within our friendly and professional restaurant. We hope to see you at the restaurant soon, Adam. </p>

Both private rooms are available to book. </p> </section>

<section id="sushi-description"> <h2 id="sushi" class="text-center"> Sushi </h2> <p> Plants have many amazing physical health benefits - they clean the air of impurities, they add more oxygen to the home and some are even said to help you sleep better. In terms of mental well-being, there is nothing more rewarding than starting out as a complete plant novice and managing to keep your plants alive and thriving for months and months to come. </p>
